          I'm Francisco J. Carmona, a spanish full­stack web developer living in Madrid that speaks PHP and Javascript.
          I have more than 8 years of experience in developing amazing and high-performance web and mobile apps.
          I live and breathe web development. I'm a full stack geek that enjoys digging into the latest web technologies.

          My passion in web development started in Málaga, where I began programming with vanilla js and jQuery in the front-end
          and raw PHP in the back-end (with an own PHP framework). After that I realized that if I wanted to build reliable,
          scalable, maintainable and well-architected web applications I had to dig into web frameworks. So that is what I did!
          Codeigniter was the initial point of my journey in back­end frameworks, then I continued with FuelPHP and currently
          I am using Laravel, Slim, Lumen and some components of Symfony. In front­end I started coding with BackboneJs and AngularJs,
          and right now I  ́m immersed in Angular and learning React and Vue.

          Nowadays it is important to automate the non-human part of the software development process. That is why I use Jenkins,
          Gitlab CI and Travis for CI/CD and SonarQube for static analysis of code.
